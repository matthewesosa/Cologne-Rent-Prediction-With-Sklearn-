# Cologne-Rent-Prediction-With-Sklearn-
This repository contains the code (jupyter notebook) and a 'research paper' detailing the goal, steps, observations and results for this project.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The project goal is to design a system that will determine the maximum rent for a specific appartment or house in the city of cologne, given it's features. Then using the selected model :

* Investors will make an investment-decision based on how much rent they should claim, find properties that are currently undervalued or to see what impact decisions like refurbishment would have on the rent price.

* Investors that already own real-estate can gain insight into the housing-market: The model will serve as a service-tool to evaluate if the current rent is too high or too low compared to the other objects in Cologne.

* We are dealing with a supervised-learning regression task (with the label [y-value] being the feature 'totalRent', so we should use one of the regression models that gives the best performance.
